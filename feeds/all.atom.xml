&lt;p&gt;Removed a Qml import line that prevented the Webcamoid to launch in pre-compiled packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ARM packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added ARM packages to the download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Snap Store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webcamoid is now also available in the Stap Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://snapcraft.io/webcamoid"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the user interface improvements, the controls in the interface were arranged just a bit better specially to work well with small screen devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20230610-1/00%20-%20Webcamoid%20in%20small%20screens.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20230610-1/00%20-%20Webcamoid%20in%20small%20screens.webp" alt="Webcamoid in small screens" title="Webcamoid in small screens" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Android support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Android app of Webcamoid has finally an official release. Most features of Webcamoid should be working acceptably fine, with a few exceptions like the camera flash which isn't working by the moment, but is at least a good advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20230610-1/01%20-%20Android.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20230610-1/01%20-%20Android.webp" alt="Android" title="Android" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mac support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/08/22/apple-silicon-macs-will-require-signed-code/"&gt;news says&lt;/a&gt; and many users reported me, Apple has enforced code signing for apps working with it's ARM processors, therefore all pre-compiled binaries were removed from download because it make no sense to release binary packages that won't never work in other computers, since Webcamoid 9.1 and forward you will have to &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/wiki/Build-and-install-in-Mac"&gt;compile it&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; or install it from &lt;a href="https://brew.sh/"&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
All Mac-specific code were removed and the functionality was switched to 3rd party libraries that offers more or less the same functionality, as following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CoreAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PortAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SDL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;playback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;AVFoundation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Screen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;AVFoundation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;QCamera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Camera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way it will make much easier for me to maintain the code.&lt;br&gt;
People that want to maintain Webcamoid's code and homebrew packages for Mac are very welcome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flatpak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Webcamoid's features including the virtual camera are working in the Flatpak package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better accessibility features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface is fully accessible by screen readers and easy navigable with the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some new features has been added to Webcamoid 9.1.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image file as video source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image capture to clipboard (thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/iam-TJ"&gt;@iam-TJ&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PortAudio and SDL as alternative audio device plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QCamera as alternative camera capture plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FFmpeg screen capture support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New and improved video Effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New effects added like AnalogTV, Zoom, Crop, and Opacity, and other improved effects like Warhol and Waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20230610-1/02%20-%20Video%20effects.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20230610-1/02%20-%20Video%20effects.webp" alt="Video effects" title="Video effects" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 9.0.0 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2022/02/15/webcamoid-900-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2022-02-15:/posts/2022/02/15/webcamoid-900-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remastered GUI, added PipeWire support, fixed video recording, security bug fix, now accepting donations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Remastered GUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after 2 years of hard work I can present the new and more modern graphical interface. I took inspiration from phone camera apps to give a similar experience to the user, but still preserving the same features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/00%20-%20Main.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/00%20-%20Main.webp" alt="Main window" title="Main window" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All UI components were designed taking as reference the &lt;a href="https://material.io/"&gt;Material style&lt;/a&gt; guidelines but adapting it to work with both PC and phone devices, and adapting it to the color scheme of your desktop.&lt;br&gt;
You can see bellow how the camera controls looks with the new design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/01%20-%20Camera%20Controls.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/01%20-%20Camera%20Controls.webp" alt="Camera controls" title="Camera controls" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Photos and videos previews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to phone camera apps, you can now open the last photo or video taken clicking the preview in the bottom left or right corner, it will open the file in your default image viewer or video player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/02%20-%20Photo%20preview.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/02%20-%20Photo%20preview.webp" alt="Last photo preview" title="Last photo preview" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Added PipeWire support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Webcamoid have screen capture support for Wayland using PipeWire. I if you are using Wayland, go to &lt;em&gt;Menu &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; General Options &amp;gt; Desktop capture&lt;/em&gt; and select &lt;strong&gt;PipeWire screen capture&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/03%20-%20PipeWire%20Wayland%20capture.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/03%20-%20PipeWire%20Wayland%20capture.webp" alt="PipeWire Wayland capture" title="PipeWire Wayland capture" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;VLC playback support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous versions of Webcamoid, FFmpeg was the default video playback back-end, which had the problem of choppy audio, now VLC is used as default back-end which offers a more fluent video playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virtual camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, many developers Mac and Windows developers asked how they can use the Webcamoid's virtual camera for their own projects, other users also reported errors when uninstalling Webcamoid it leaves the virtual camera still present in their system, plus other bugs, and many other bugs, for these reason the virtual camera was splited to its own project, you can now use the virtual camera by separate, and Webcamoid also gives to option to download and install it when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/04%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20install.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/04%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20install.webp" alt="Virtual camera install" title="Virtual camera install" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When clicking on &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt;, Webcamoid will download the appropriate virtual camera for your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/05%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20download.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/05%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20download.webp" alt="Virtual camera download" title="Virtual camera download" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt; and follow the virtual camera install instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/06%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20install%20confirmation.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/06%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20install%20confirmation.webp" alt="Virtual camera install confirmation" title="Virtual camera install confirmation" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webamoid 9.0.0 offers many options to customize the virtual camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/07%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20management.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/07%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20management.webp" alt="Virtual camera management" title="Virtual camera management" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating the camera you will have the option to define the formats, resolutions, and frame rates of the virtual camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/08%20-%20Configuring%20the%20virtual%20camera.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/08%20-%20Configuring%20the%20virtual%20camera.webp" alt="Configuring the virtual camera" title="Configuring the virtual camera" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you will get the virtual camera ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/09%20-%20The%20virtual%20camera%20is%20ready%20to%20use.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/09%20-%20The%20virtual%20camera%20is%20ready%20to%20use.webp" alt="Virtual camera ready" title="Virtual camera ready" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also control how the virtual camera will be seen in the client side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/10%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20settings.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/10%20-%20Virtual%20camera%20settings.webp" alt="Virtual camera settings" title="Virtual camera settings" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the most wanted features was setting the default camera picture, which now Webcamoid offers the option to customize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20220215-1/11%20-%20Configuring%20the%20default%20picture%20for%20the%20virtual%20camera.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20220215-1/11%20-%20Configuring%20the%20default%20picture%20for%20the%20virtual%20camera.webp" alt="Virtual camera default picture" title="Virtual camera default picture" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Improved effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added face tracking plugin that detect, follow, and zoom in to your face, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/cjbarth"&gt;Chris Barth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Many others improvements were made by &lt;a href="https://github.com/cont1nuity"&gt;cont1nuity&lt;/a&gt;, like adding support for background image replacement, fixing masks rendering,and adding more options in FaceDetect plugin.&lt;br&gt;
Also added a new Otsu threshold plugin which do a smart classification by gray levels. FalseColor has now a more intuitive settings. ASCII art plugin algorithm also received some optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security bug fix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous versions, when creating, editing, or removing a virtual camera a script was created with the purpose of configuring the virtual camera in the system, the script required in most cases Administrative privileges, an attacker could detect when that script was created and append malicious code inside. This bug was fixed and no script is created in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixed video recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many users reported problems with blank files when recoding, this bug was fixed and also added support for compiling with FFmpeg 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now accepting donations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many users asked me over the years how they can donate to the project, I've added many options to donate, from flat money to crypto currencies, as a one unique or regular payments, in the most popular sites. Of course, Webcamoid development won't change, Webcamoid is still a &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/blob/master/COPYING"&gt;Free Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt; project, no feature will be locked under any paywall. Any donation amount is welcome and very appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.8.0 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2021/02/16/webcamoid-880-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2021-02-16:/posts/2021/02/16/webcamoid-880-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fixed auto exposure bug in Windows, improved FaceDetect plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Fixed auto exposure bug in Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/148"&gt;very hard to catch bug&lt;/a&gt; since not all webcams has this control and it was not clear how it was triggered. The bug consisted in Webcamoid turning off all boolean type controls (auto. exposure, auto. focus, etc.) with the exposure control being the most affected one turning the image darker, and since Windows does not provides any native options for setting the controls back, users needed to use 3rd-party programs to fix the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bug is finally fixed once for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved FaceDetect plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this release was more focused on fixing the above bug, I did not wanted to make an almost void release for the rest of the platforms so I've back ported some small but interesting changes from &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid"&gt;Webcamoid's master branch&lt;/a&gt;. And one of those interesting changes is that the FaceDetect plugin can now blur the outsides of the detected faces (&lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/pull/332"&gt;PR #332&lt;/a&gt;) and the face detection algorithm can be used directly in other plugins (&lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/pull/329"&gt;PR #329&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks you very much to &lt;a href="https://github.com/kno10"&gt;Erich Schubert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/cjbarth"&gt;Chris Barth&lt;/a&gt; for this improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.7.1 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2019/10/22/webcamoid-871-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-22T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2019-10-22:/posts/2019/10/22/webcamoid-871-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bug fixes for Mac and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;VERY IMPORTANT ADVICE PLEASE READ!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** To solve all the bugs mentioned bellow, please remove all virtual cameras and create a new one. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug fixes targeting Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release was specially intended to fix bugs impacting Mac users experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most important bug to fix was a memory grow that happened when the video frames was sent to the virtual camera but the program in the other side was slow receiving them, what happened was that since the target program was slow, Webcamoid was keep sending the frames, but the frames keep accumulating because the target program was not able to process them. This problem was solved by syncing the frames so now Webcamoid will wait until the frames are processed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem to solve is that in order to have access to the camera in newer Mac releases the user need to give capture permissions to the program so it can capture from the camera. This problem has been fixed too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, there has been some experiments trying to bring camera controls support (contrast brightness, gamma, etc.) without much luck. The methods used could conflict with AVFoundation API, so the controls are disabled for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug fixes targeting Mac and Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In older versions of the virtual camera for Mac and Windows, the default frame of the virtual camera plugin was loaded from the resources embedded in the binary, but since the internal resources format was tied to Qt, if Qt changed the internal format of the resources the plugin won't be able to load the resources because the plugin does not make use of Qt.&lt;br&gt;
Instead of doing some hackery to load the frame from resources, the plugins will load the frames directly from file.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.7.0 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2019/10/01/webcamoid-870-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2019-10-01:/posts/2019/10/01/webcamoid-870-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Android port status, fixed camera blinking, many bug fixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Android port keep moving forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webcamoid for Android is nearest that never. Even though Webcamoid is not ready to be used in Android yet, there has been a lot of advances to make it work in the mobile platform. All its basic features are working: camera capture, screen capture, video playback and recording.&lt;br&gt;
The UI still does not play well with small screen devices, this is a pending task that will be solved before the official release.&lt;br&gt;
You can read more at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/169"&gt;Android port&lt;/a&gt; issue. Also, if you feel a bit adventurous you can download and test the APK at the &lt;a href="https://bintray.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/webcamoid/daily#files/android"&gt;daily build&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fixed camera blinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you changed the format, resolution or FPS, Webcamoid was turning on and off the webcam quickly many times, if you had a webcam with a led indicator, you can notice the led was blinking many times when you changed the format.&lt;br&gt;
I think this is related to issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/148"&gt;#148&lt;/a&gt;, this bug was probably triggering a hardware bug that did not allowed the camera to recover its normal parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug fixes and improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many unnecessary plugins were removed like Bin and Probe plugins. Also, unnecessary sub-modules like OSS and QtAudio were removed.&lt;br&gt;
Also, error messages for the virtual camera were improved, making a bit easier to debug problems when installing the virtual camera.&lt;br&gt;
And finally there were fixed some elusive segfaults when switching between effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.6.1 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2019/03/26/webcamoid-861-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-03-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2019-03-26:/posts/2019/03/26/webcamoid-861-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;AppImage icon, fixed Mac and Windows build, fixed man page install.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;AppImage icon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;a href="https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher"&gt;AppImageLauncher&lt;/a&gt; installed in your system, it can detect and set the icon for the AppImage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixes for Windows and Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users reported that they can't launch Webcamoid in these systems, this bug was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Man page install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manual pages are now installed in &lt;em&gt;/usr/share/man/man1&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;/usr/share/man&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.6.0 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2019/03/05/webcamoid-860-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-03-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2019-03-05:/posts/2019/03/05/webcamoid-860-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Daily builds, better GStreamer support, many fixes for MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Test the latest changes with the daily builds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 8.5.0 the only way of trying new changes in Webcamoid was &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/wiki/Raw-build-and-install"&gt;compiling it&lt;/a&gt;, and that means you need to setup a full development environment installing an IDE and configuring it, installing the required libraries, modifying the environment variables and so on. Even when Webcamoid is not that hard to build once you have everything you need, setting up all prerequisites can be overwhelming for non technical users. Otherwise, the only way of testing new things was waiting for a new release, that could take weeks, months or even years.&lt;br&gt;
From now on, you don't need to wait for a new release anymore, you can test all latest changes in the daily &lt;a href="https://bintray.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/webcamoid/daily/link"&gt;build repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved GStreamer support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In older versions when you set GStreamer as recording engine only the primary codecs were enabled, that is the codecs that GStreamer consider well tested, the problem is that many formats and codecs were missing, now the threshold is more relaxed and secondary plugins are supported too, so now you have a broader spectrum of codecs to choose from when recording. Also segfaults and memleaks were fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixed segfaults and memory leaks in MacOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being working for more than a year in a release, you be tested everything and everything seems to be right and working ok, no problems running the binary packages, but at the moment of uploading the binary packages... baam! users report that they can't launch the program, you check everything and again nothing is wrong. It seems that some incompatibilities related to using a too recent version of MacOS to build Webcamoid caused problems in the target systems. To avoid this problem, from now on all MacOS binaries are build in older MacOS versions.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, a there was a memleak when playing a webcam, a video or the desktop, this bug was also solved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.5.0 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2019/01/22/webcamoid-850-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-22T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-01-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2019-01-22:/posts/2019/01/22/webcamoid-850-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reworked virtual camera drivers, UI ported to QtQuick Controls 2, fixed recording bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Virtual camera drivers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the feature that consumed most part of the development time. The virtual camera for GNU/Linux, Mac and Windows was rewritten from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For GNU/Linux, in addition to &lt;a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback"&gt;v4l2loopback&lt;/a&gt; support, there was also added support for &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/akvcam"&gt;akvcam&lt;/a&gt; driver. &lt;strong&gt;akvcam&lt;/strong&gt; is an in-house v4l2 driver for Linux designed to offer the same exact features offered by Mac and Windows drivers, like for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emulated camera controls (brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configurable default picture in case no input signal available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more advantages of this driver, you can check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/akvcam/wiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20190122-1/VCamInFFandChr.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20190122-1/VCamInFFandChr.webp" alt="Virtual camera working in Chromium and Firefox" title="Virtual camera working in Chromium and Firefox" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous versions of Webcamoid, the virtual camera for Mac was implemented using &lt;a href="https://github.com/Syphon"&gt;Syphon&lt;/a&gt;, this was far from ideal since the capturing program need to implement a Syphon client and AVFoundation (the default video capture API for OS X) capable programs can't capture from a Syphon server. Since Webcamoid 8.5.0, the virtual camera is implemented as a CoreMediaIO plugin, so now this is can be detected by any AVFoundation capable program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;since OS X 10.14, the virtual camera plugin need to be signed&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise some programs (mostly from App Store) will not be able to detect the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows virtual camera also received many improvements. Old version was based on DirectShow BaseClasses which had an ambiguous license, so it made quite hard to distribute the code, later Microsoft re-licensed the code of BaseClasses to a clear very well known MIT license, so licensing is not a problem now, but some technical and portability problems still persisted. The code had many problems keeping track of new changes in MSVC and MinGW, it depended on  certain libraries to be loaded dynamically on run-time, 32 bits programs where not able to see the webcam from 64 bits Webcamoid and vice-versa, it was not possible to create more than one virtual camera at same time, and only one instance of Webcamoid was able to send frames to the virtual camera at time. All those problems are solved in Webcamoid 8.5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: many programs based on DirectShow may be able to detect and use the camera, but those &lt;strong&gt;programs based on Microsoft Media Foundation will not work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a full compatibility &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/wiki/Virtual-camera-support"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QtQuick Controls 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Qt deprecating QQC1 it was necessary to port the UI to QQC2, there is not any remarkable visual difference between the old and the new UI, that was only an API change. Some bugs and glitches may appears, but is too late to go back to QQC1 or rewrite the UI completely, despite of this, most of them can be worked around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain cases when you tried to record a video with audio enabled, it crashed, it happened because the alignment of the samples was not taken into account. In Windows, audio was not recorded at all, this bug was caused because the supported formats were not read and set properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you changed the capture resolution of the webcam, Webcamoid was not aware of the change and it was still recording in the default resolution (640x480 in most cases). Also, default video bit rate is now 1.5 Mbps instead of 200 kbps for better video quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this bugs were fixed with this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crash on launch fixed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some platforms when you tried to run Webcamoid it crashed straightforward, it was caused by certain combination of Qt and the used compiler, the cause is unknown but anyway it was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Media Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMF is the new multimedia framework created by Microsoft and is intended to supersede DirectShow, support for MMF is enabled if you compile Webcamoid with MSVC. MMF is not yet supported in MinGW.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.1.0 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2017/10/10/webcamoid-810-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-10T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-10-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2017-10-10:/posts/2017/10/10/webcamoid-810-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bug fix, binary packages shrinked, added Syphon support for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Many bug fix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous version there were a problem when audio recording was enabled in which after a few seconds of recording Webcamoid freezed, this problem may be solved and audio recording is enabled by default now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this version, startup time may be improved after removed unnecessary checks in plugins load. Webcamoid may have a bit slow startup just the first time and load faster in successive runs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There where many reports of random crashes with almost nothing in common, and I can confirm Webcamoid crashed randomly sometimes, after an exhaustive memory leak scan with Valgrind and Dr. Memory, I found many problems related to how video frames were displayed in the screen, so Webcamoid may be more stable now. Also, enabled linear filtering for frames display.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mac, screen capture glitched a lot making impossible to do a smooth screen capture recording, this is because Qt uses Cocoa for screen capture, after adding support for AVFoundation in screen capture, the problem was solved.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed default install paths for Windows installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduced binary packages size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I applied a proper cleaning of debug symbols and unnecessary files, this change is more noticeable for Mac and Windows users. Webcamoid will consume less disc space than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virtual camera for Mac through Syphon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual camera support in Mac is a bit tricky, if you want to share frames with other webcams programs, and do it well, you need to write a kernel extension, and kernel extensions requires signing, and signing requires payment, and at this point is not possible, yet I'm not discarding that option.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the best solution I've found for now is Syphon for sharing frames with other programs, Syphon is a framework that allow sharing frames as OpenGL textures with other programs also using Syphon. This is More or less a solution for the virtual camera, and I guess most Free Open Source programs will not have problem adding support for Syphon, if they didn't yet, for closed source programs it's a different story.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Webcamoid 8.0.0 released!</title><link href="https://webcamoid.github.io/posts/2017/05/16/webcamoid-800-released/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-16T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-05-16T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:webcamoid.github.io,2017-05-16:/posts/2017/05/16/webcamoid-800-released/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mac support, more audio options, more recording options, more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Support for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding support for Mac was one of the most important ojectives for Webcamoid 8.0.0, since there was not many Free Open Source webcam apps for this platform. I hope Webcamoid can fill the gap for Open Source enthusiasts using Mac, and users of this platform in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/WebcamoidInMac.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/WebcamoidInMac.webp" alt="Webcamoid in Mac" title="Webcamoid in Mac" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Support for FreeBSD/TrueOs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few small fixes, Webcamoid is now finally working pretty well in this platform. Webcamoid requires V4L and Linux compatibility layer to be enabled in your system. If Webcamoid doesn't list any webcam, in order to make it work, first you must list your USB devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo usbconfig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All your webcam devices will be listed as &lt;em&gt;ugenX.Y&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt; are numbers. And then you must map that device to a v4l device:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo webcamd -d ugenX.Y -i 0 -v Z -B
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;strong&gt;Z&lt;/strong&gt; is the number of V4L device where you want to map the ugen device, so it will appear as &lt;em&gt;/dev/videoZ&lt;/em&gt; in Webcamoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/WebcamoidInTrueOS.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/WebcamoidInTrueOS.webp" alt="Webcamoid in TrueOS" title="Webcamoid in TrueOS" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Improved audio configs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous versions only PulseAudio was supported; now Webcamoid supports 4 new systems: ALSA, JACK, OSS and QtMultimedia. And is also possible to select the output and input you want to use for playback and capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/InputDeviceSelection.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/InputDeviceSelection.webp" alt="Input device selection" title="Input device selection" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each input and output, you can set the sample format, number of channels and sample rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/AudioDeviceOptions.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/AudioDeviceOptions.webp" alt="Audio device options" title="Audio device options" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More options for recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In older versions it was not possible to easily configure codecs and format parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/RecordingOptions.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/RecordingOptions.webp" alt="Recording options" title="Recording options" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now each codec offers its own config dialog, ideal for more advanced users who want to fine tune recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/CodecOptions.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/CodecOptions.webp" alt="Codec options" title="Codec options" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Libraries configs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webcamoid support FFmpeg and GStreamer for playback, recording, video and audio convertion, but in previous versions, only one of both were available at compile time, so you had to choose between using one or the other. Now, Webcamoid can be compiled with support for both frameworks and the user will be able choose between both at runtime. And not just that, users can also select the audio system and camera capture library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/LibrariesOptions.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/LibrariesOptions.webp" alt="Libraries options" title="Libraries options" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Plugin configs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers and more advanced users there is now a new menu for configuring plugins search paths where you can also enable or disable plugins you don't want to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/PluginsOptions.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/PluginsOptions.webp" alt="Plugins options" title="Plugins options" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on you will be informed if you are using an old or a development version of Webcamoid, so you can be up to date with bleeding edge features and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="img-preview"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/images/20170516-1/Updates.webp"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/20170516-1/Updates.webp" alt="Updates" title="Updates" /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installers and portables for GNU/Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNU/Linux users will not need to wait for Weamoid to be packaged for their distros, and they will not need to use an outdated version anymore. Since Webcamoid 8.0.0 you will be able to install it from a nice graphical installer or, if you prefer, run it as a portable program, just make it executable and click it to run.&lt;/p&gt;
