                <h2>Many bug fix</h2>
<p>In previous version there were a problem when audio recording was enabled in which after a few seconds of recording Webcamoid freezed, this problem may be solved and audio recording is enabled by default now.  </p>
<p>In this version, startup time may be improved after removed unnecessary checks in plugins load. Webcamoid may have a bit slow startup just the first time and load faster in successive runs.  </p>
<p>There where many reports of random crashes with almost nothing in common, and I can confirm Webcamoid crashed randomly sometimes, after an exhaustive memory leak scan with Valgrind and Dr. Memory, I found many problems related to how video frames were displayed in the screen, so Webcamoid may be more stable now. Also, enabled linear filtering for frames display.  </p>
<p>In Mac, screen capture glitched a lot making impossible to do a smooth screen capture recording, this is because Qt uses Cocoa for screen capture, after adding support for AVFoundation in screen capture, the problem was solved.  </p>
<p>Fixed default install paths for Windows installer.</p>
<h2>Reduced binary packages size</h2>
<p>This time I applied a proper cleaning of debug symbols and unnecessary files, this change is more noticeable for Mac and Windows users. Webcamoid will consume less disc space than before.</p>
<h2>Virtual camera for Mac through Syphon</h2>
<p>Virtual camera support in Mac is a bit tricky, if you want to share frames with other webcams programs, and do it well, you need to write a kernel extension, and kernel extensions requires signing, and signing requires payment, and at this point is not possible, yet I'm not discarding that option.  </p>
<p>So the best solution I've found for now is Syphon for sharing frames with other programs, Syphon is a framework that allow sharing frames as OpenGL textures with other programs also using Syphon. This is More or less a solution for the virtual camera, and I guess most Free Open Source programs will not have problem adding support for Syphon, if they didn't yet, for closed source programs it's a different story.</p>
