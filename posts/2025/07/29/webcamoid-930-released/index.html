                <p>A new release of Webcamoid is avalible, bringing a wealth of new features, performance optimizations, and critical bug fixes.   This update enhances video processing capabilities, improves user experience, and expands platform support, making it a significant milestone for the project. Below, we dive into the key changes introduced in Webcamoid 9.3.0.</p>
<h1>New Features</h1>
<h2>Enhanced Video Processing with SIMD Support</h2>
<p>Webcamoid 9.3.0 introduces support for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, including MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2, NEON, SVE, and RVV. These are unified under a common interface called AkSimd, enabling optimized video processing for improved performance across compatible hardware. Additionally, specialized 8-bit video conversion functions, tailored for SIMD, further boost efficiency.</p>
<h2>OpenMP Integration</h2>
<p>The inclusion of OpenMP support allows Webcamoid to leverage multi-core processors more effectively, enhancing parallel processing for tasks like video encoding and rendering.</p>
<h2>Expanded Platform Support</h2>
<p>This release adds support for Android TV, making Webcamoid more versatile for users on smart TV platforms. It also introduces PipeWire audio support, improving audio handling on GNU/Linux systems. For Windows users, Webcamoid now prioritizes Microsoft Media Foundation over DirectShow for camera capture, ensuring better compatibility and performance.</p>
<h2>Streamlined Video Recording</h2>
<p>Webcamoid 9.3.0 limits video recording formats and codecs to web-compatible options, simplifying maintenance and ensuring broad compatibility with video players. Supported formats and codecs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WebM</strong>: Video codecs (AV1, VP9, VP8), Audio codecs (Opus, Vorbis)</li>
<li><strong>MP4</strong>: Video codec (H.264), Audio codecs (AAC, MP3)</li>
</ul>
<p>This focused approach reduces complexity and minimizes bugs in video recording workflows.</p>
<h2>User Interface Enhancements</h2>

    </a>
</div>

<p>The update introduces customizable UI color schemes with default options, allowing users to personalize their experience. A new "Help" option in the main menu provides easier access to documentation. Additionally, platform information printing has been added for better debugging, and translations have been updated for German (95.7%), Turkish (53.1%), Estonian (52.8%), Hebrew (73.4%), Dutch (83.9%), and Italian (13.4%) via Weblate.</p>
