This update enhances video processing capabilities, improves user experience, and expands platform support, making it a significant milestone for the project. Below, we dive into the key changes introduced in Webcamoid 9.3.0.

# New Features

## Enhanced Video Processing with SIMD Support

Webcamoid 9.3.0 introduces support for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, including MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2, NEON, SVE, and RVV. These are unified under a common interface called AkSimd, enabling optimized video processing for improved performance across compatible hardware. Additionally, specialized 8-bit video conversion functions, tailored for SIMD, further boost efficiency.

## OpenMP Integration

The inclusion of OpenMP support allows Webcamoid to leverage multi-core processors more effectively, enhancing parallel processing for tasks like video encoding and rendering.

## Expanded Platform Support

This release adds support for Android TV, making Webcamoid more versatile for users on smart TV platforms. It also introduces PipeWire audio support, improving audio handling on GNU/Linux systems. For Windows users, Webcamoid now prioritizes Microsoft Media Foundation over DirectShow for camera capture, ensuring better compatibility and performance.

## Streamlined Video Recording

Webcamoid 9.3.0 limits video recording formats and codecs to web-compatible options, simplifying maintenance and ensuring broad compatibility with video players. Supported formats and codecs include:

- **WebM**: Video codecs (AV1, VP9, VP8), Audio codecs (Opus, Vorbis)
- **MP4**: Video codec (H.264), Audio codecs (AAC, MP3)

This focused approach reduces complexity and minimizes bugs in video recording workflows.

## User Interface Enhancements

# Additional Improvements

## UI and User Experience

The video recording API has been enhanced with standardized codec and format options, making it easier for developers and users to configure recordings. PipeWire (Wayland) screen capture is now disabled when using X11/XLibre (and vice versa) to prevent conflicts.

## Other Changes

- The librav1e codec has been disabled in FFmpeg for Windows and Linux-mingw builds due to crashes.
- A minimum font point size of 10 has been set for Windows to improve readability.
