Date: 2024-10-01  
Summary: Port to Qt6, many Android improvements, color key support, debug log  

## General improvements

One of the first an most important changes for this release was that Webcamoid was finally ported to Qt6, it took a long time but Webcamoid is up to date.  
For the desktop version of Webcamoid, it was added the option of capturing the screen using FFmpeg, and also it was added the option to show or hide the mouse cursor for all platforms were this feature is available.  
Another feature with high demand that what added is the chroma key support that allows to replace a certain color with an image or a different color.

When changing the camera format and resolution, [Webcamoid was not able to save the settings](https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/693), this issue was fixed in this release.  
In previous versions, debugging Webcamoid in Android and Windows was a complicated task due to that you had to enable the developer mode in Android to read the system log and get some information from there, in Windows is even more complex due to that in Windows, graphical applications does not print any log in the command line, that's why it was added a debug log to the preferences dialog where you can look at all error messages (and other normal messages).

In this release the phone torch is working in both, when taking a photo and when recording a video, in phones and tablets were the torch is not available in the frontal camera, Webcamoid will flash with a white screen for a few seconds before taking a photo.  
Also fixed the font scaling so all the normal and formatted text is shown properly in the UI.

## Improvements for GNU/Linux

Now Webcamoid can share the camera with other programs using PipeWire for camera capture.
