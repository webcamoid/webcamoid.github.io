Date: 2023-06-10  
Summary: Android, about Mac support, UI in small screens, Flatpak.  

## UI improvement

Continuing with the user interface improvements, the controls in the interface were arranged just a bit better specially to work well with small screen devices.

    </a>
</div>

## Android support

The Android app of Webcamoid has finally an official release. Most features of Webcamoid should be working acceptably fine, with a few exceptions like the camera flash which isn't working by the moment, but is at least a good advance.

    </a>

## Mac support

As [news says](https://eclecticlight.co/2020/08/22/apple-silicon-macs-will-require-signed-code/) and many users reported me, Apple has enforced code signing for apps working with it's ARM processors, therefore all pre-compiled binaries were removed from download because it make no sense to release binary packages that won't never work in other computers, since Webcamoid 9.1 and forward you will have to [compile it](https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/wiki/Build-and-install-in-Mac) from [source code](https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid) or install it from [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  
All Mac-specific code were removed and the functionality was switched to 3rd party libraries that offers more or less the same functionality, as following:

```
CoreAudio -> PortAudio and SDL (Audio capture and playback)
AVFoundation -> FFmpeg (Screen capture)
AVFoundation -> QCamera (Camera capture)
```

This way it will make much easier for me to maintain the code.  
People that want to maintain Webcamoid's code and homebrew packages for Mac are very welcome.  

## Flatpak

All Webcamoid's features including the virtual camera are working in the Flatpak package.

## Better accessibility features

The user interface is fully accessible by screen readers and easy navigable with the keyboard.

## New features

Some new features has been added to Webcamoid 9.1.0:

- Image file as video source.
- Image capture to clipboard (thanks to [@iam-TJ](https://github.com/iam-TJ)!)
- PortAudio and SDL as alternative audio device plugins.
- QCamera as alternative camera capture plugin.
- FFmpeg screen capture support.

## New and improved video Effects
