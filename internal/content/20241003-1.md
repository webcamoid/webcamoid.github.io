Title: Webcamoid 9.2.3 released!  
Date: 2024-10-03  
Summary: Remove VLC playback in Windows, a bit wider support for GNU/Linux binaries, and other minor fixes.  

Disabled binary build with libVLC in Windows since [some anti-malware software detects](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/36c63f9a9c4a9d91eb888a0061c67d65396f28662f385a913c46a2d8032de692/behavior) its usage as malware even though is clean. You can still build Webcamoid with VLC support from Cmake command options.  
Let make it clear, **the users were NEVER exposed to a real risk**.  
Build GNU/Linux binaries from Debian, this give a bit wider range of supported distros.
Also other minor fixes added to the packages released.

## Edit

I have communicated with the support of the both anti-virus that give the false positive, [ViIt](https://www.tgsoft.it/) and [Norton](https://norton.com/). Communication with ViIt team was super fast, and they solved the problem in less than 1 day 👌, in the other side, talking with Norton support was like talking to a bot, they did not even asked to send any file for analysis or anything, they probably did not care about anything, and most probably did not solved nothing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
